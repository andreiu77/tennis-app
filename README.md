## Features

- **Authentication & Authorization** — Email/password login powered by NextAuth.js, with role-based access control (`USER` / `ADMIN`).
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** — Optional TOTP-based 2FA using Google Authenticator–compatible apps. Users can scan a QR code to set up their second factor.
- **Player CRUD** — Create, read, update, and delete tennis player profiles with server-side validation.
- **Player Cards with Ranking Tiers** — Players are displayed in ranked cards color-coded into Gold, Silver, and Bronze tiers.
- **Detail Page with Inline Editing** — View full player details, toggle edit mode to update fields, change the player image, and upload highlight videos.
- **Video Upload with Progress Bar** — Upload match/highlight videos per player, with a real-time progress indicator and in-browser playback + download.
- **Image Selector** — Pick from server-hosted images to set a player's profile picture.
- **Search & Sort** — Filter players by name and sort by ranking (ascending/descending) from the main page header.
- **Pagination** — Configurable number of players per page (3, 4, 5, or 6) with full pagination controls.
- **Statistics Dashboard** — Interactive Pie and Bar charts (Chart.js / Recharts) visualizing player data distributions.
- **Top Racket Brands** — A dedicated page ranking racket brands by the number of players using them.
- **Real-Time Player Generation (WebSocket)** — Start/stop a WebSocket server that periodically generates random players and broadcasts them to all connected clients, updating charts live.
- **Admin: Monitored Users Table** — Admins see a table of users who have been flagged by the background monitoring script for high activity.
- **Activity Logging** — Every ADD, UPDATE, and DELETE action is logged per user for auditing.
- **Background Monitoring Script** — A standalone script (`npm run monitor-script`) that runs every 2 minutes, flagging users with more than 20 actions in the last 24 hours.
- **Toast Notifications** — User-friendly feedback via `react-hot-toast` for validation errors and important events.
- **Seeded Demo Data** — Prisma seed script pre-populates the database with sample users, racket brands, and famous tennis players.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- **npm** ≥ 9 (comes with Node.js)
- **PostgreSQL** ≥ 14 — running locally or remotely

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andreiu77/tennis-app.git
cd tennis-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (or edit the existing one). The required variables are:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<user>:<password>@localhost:5432/Tennisdb"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="<your-random-secret>"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

> Replace `<user>`, `<password>`, and the database name with your actual PostgreSQL credentials.

---

## Database Setup

### 1. Create the PostgreSQL Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE "Tennisdb";
```

### 2. Run Prisma Migrations

This creates the tables defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 3. Generate the Prisma Client

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### 4. Seed the Database (Optional)

Populate the database with demo users, racket brands, and players:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

**Seeded accounts:**

| Email               | Password            | Role    | 2FA Enabled |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `admin@example.com` | `hashed-password-admin` | `ADMIN` | No          |
| `user@example.com`  | `hashed-password-user`  | `USER`  | Yes         |

> ⚠️ The seed script uses placeholder password hashes. Replace them with real bcrypt hashes for production use.

---

## Running the Application

### Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. You will be redirected to the login page if not authenticated.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Background Monitoring Script

In a separate terminal, start the monitoring script that flags users with excessive activity:

```bash
npm run monitor-script
```

This script checks every **2 minutes** for users with more than **20 logged actions** in the last 24 hours and adds them to the `MonitoredUser` table.

---

## Running Tests

The project includes both **API tests** and **frontend component tests** using Jest and React Testing Library.

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## WebSocket (Real-Time Updates)

The application includes a **WebSocket server** (running on `ws://localhost:3001`) that periodically generates random tennis players using Faker.js and broadcasts them to all connected clients.

**How it works:**

1. Navigate to the **Statistics Page**.
2. Click **"Start WebSocket Server"** to begin generating random players.
3. The charts update in real-time as new players are created.
4. Click **"Stop WebSocket Server"** to halt generation and disconnect clients.

The client-side connection is managed by the `usePlayerWebSocket` custom hook.

---

## Monitoring Script

The monitoring script (`scripts/monitor.ts`) is a standalone background process that:

1. Queries the `Log` table for users with **more than 20 actions** in the past **24 hours**.
2. Upserts matching users into the `MonitoredUser` table.
3. Repeats every **2 minutes**.

Admins can view flagged users from the **Monitored Users Table** on the main page.

```bash
npm run monitor-script
```

---
